# Python Code Generator

## Description
This application is designed to automate the generation and testing of Python code for a variety of programming tasks.
It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model to create code based on user input or randomly selected prompts.
The script iteratively improves the code by generating, testing, and fixing errors until the generated code passes all unit tests.

## Features
- **Automated Code Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate Python code based on user-defined prompts.
- **Iterative Testing and Debugging**: Automatically tests the generated code and iteratively improves it.
- **Support for Various Programming Tasks**: Includes predefined programming tasks, and also supports custom tasks input by the user.
- **Unit Test Generation**: Automatically generates unit tests for the created code.
- **Interactive User Input**: Allows users to input their desired programming task or select a random one from a predefined list.
